# Agency Financial MIS Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a **financial MIS (Management Information System) dashboard** built in Power BI to track and analyze the performance of a freelancer / agency-style business.

The focus is not just on visuals, but on **clear business questions**:
- Are we profitable?
- How does performance change month to month?
- Which clients and services actually drive profit?

The report is structured into **three focused views**, each answering a different business need:

### 1. Executive Overview
- High-level KPIs: Revenue, Cost, Profit, Profit Margin  
- Revenue & Profit trend by month

Designed for quick decision-making.

### 2. Monthly Performance Analysis

This view helps identify **patterns, slowdowns, and margin pressure** over time.

### 3. Client & Service Breakdown
